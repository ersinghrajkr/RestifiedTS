Please have example folder for how to use core and advance feature for end user. it must have
  organized structure to complex API Testting or say microservices architecture, also include graphql,
   database intreaction and configuration example, example for authentication, example for http client
   multiple instance etc

● I'll create a comprehensive examples folder with organized structure for complex API testing
  scenarios including microservices, GraphQL, database interactions, and more.
